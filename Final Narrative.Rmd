## Research Question & Motivation

Our research question centers on examining how treatment-related factors influence quality of life outcomes, from admission to discharge, in public substance abuse facilities. By identifying key treatment-related factors that impact the quality of life for individuals undergoing substance use treatment in public facilities, we want to potentially pinpoint means or approaches to improve the efficacy of substance use treatment to different needs. Ideally, understanding the mechanisms/relationship between treatment and life outcomes can improve long-term recovery and relapse-prevention prospects for substance abuse patients. 


## Data Source & Description

### Data Context 

Our dataset is SAMHSA’s Treatment Episode Data Set in 2021, which includes client-level data of patients aged 12 or older who undergoes treatment in public-affiliated substance abuse facilities. While different states may have different operational regulations for these facilities, most facilities in the dataset receives government aid, whether that be an official state rehabilitation facility to a community clinic.  

The original dataset has in total around 1.3 million records with 76 variables, coding every variable as a numeric category, with -9 representing missing, invalid, or “other” data, while numbers from 1 to n representing the various levels in each category. For the purpose of our analysis, we only keep clients who have completed their treatment in the dataset to be able to reliably infer the treatment impact on clients. 

Of the 76 variables in the dataset, we subsetted it to just 28 variables based on what we theorize to have a high explanatory power on clients' quality of life based on conversations with experts in an effort to capture a wide scope of impact. The variables correspond to 4 categories:

1. **Demographic factors**: Education, Race, Marital Status, etc. 

2. **Treatment-related factors**: what substances clients use, how frequently, when they first started using, their length of stay, and reason for leaving, etc. Treatment-related variables referred to anything that provided insight into what happened during a client’s stay. We focus on the treatment-related variables with strong predictive power on life outcomes of patients since our research questions try to examine which treatment factors might help improve the quality of life in patients. Notably, we transform our length of stay treatment variables in the analyses to comprise 3 levels: Under 1 month, 30 - 90 days, and 90 days. The 90 days, or 12 weeks, time point is hypothesized to be significant in predicting employment outcome since The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) allows job protection for 12 weeks for medical reasons.

3. **Other non-treatment variables** such as clients' mental health diagnoses and secondary & tertiary substance use. It should be noted that SUB2 and SUB3, the 2 variables listing a client’s secondary and tertiary substances, were converted into binary variables based on whether a substance was listed in that category. We primarily focus on the primary substance the client was diagnosed with since we learned from our experts that treatment plans, especially in public clinical settings, mostly focus on treating the primary substance diagnoses rather than any supplemental ones.

4. **Outcome variables**: housing, employment status, and frequency of substance use at admission and discharge. Our outcome variables were the dataset’s most tangible life outcome variables, each indicating a different aspect of life before and after a client’s stay in the facilities. 

## Results

The individual result and interpretations of our project in each quality of life indicators (frequency of use, housing status, and employment status at discharge) are included in corresponding .rmd files included in the Github repository. 

**Overall summary of results**: 

Length of stay was one of the highest-ranking treatment variables across our 3 models. Looking deeper, we see that Length of Stay interacts with our 3 outcome variables. In terms of frequency of use, we see a decrease in improvement percentage for less than 30-day length of stay relative to both higher lengths of stay.  However, less than 30 days also has the lowest rate, indicating that out of all the lengths of stay, we rarely see people's usage worsen during a stay of less than 30 days. The best improvement percentage was 30-90 days, which seems to be the optimal length of stay. When we increase above 90 days, we have a decrease in improvement and a reduction in worsening.  The rationale is as follows: in a short setting, the focus is on detoxification and stabilization with minimal time for behavioral change, leading to low improvement but also low worsening as not there for a long time. 30-90 days provide the optimal balance of time for meaningful therapy, skill-building, and habit formation, leading to the highest improvement percentages. More than 90 where we see the need for long-term care can reduce the incremental improvement the care is providing, leading to less effective treatment, which can be due to "harder" to fix patients that take longer, and we see less improvement in them.

In both housing status and employment, we see a trend where the length of stay increases, and the improvement percentage increases. We also see the worst percentage decrease or stay the same as the length of stay increases. Both of these indicate that as the length of stay increases, patients are better off in terms of housing status and employment. The reason for this could come from the long-term nature of housing and employment as people need time to move (waiting on the relator and the buying process) and time to find a job (waiting on a company to hire you), whereas the frequency of use no time element is dependent on other people. This could also come from the stability that more extended treatment gives patients, allowing them a supportive environment to focus on themselves and thus giving them the time and resources to focus on housing and employment. Further rationale for the difference between these and frequency of use is that frequency of use is directly tied to behavioral and physical factors, which can show improvement relatively quickly within the first 90 days; however, after 90 days, the improvement frequency can drop because those immediate behavioral and physical factors changes have already occurred early on and didn't work thus indicating a "harder" patient.

When it comes to the impact of treatment services and quality of life, we notice that ambulatory care setting (outpatient treatment) has a greater positive impact on employment outcome compared to rehab (inpatient) care, yet the reverse trend happens for frequency of use and housing status at discharge. For detox, its minimal impact on employment outcome may be due to the relatively shorter treatment length. The negative impact of inpatient care on employment outcome might be due to the fact that the inpatient nature of rehab/residential treatment requires clients to skip work, coupled with a lack of opportunities to network and interview for new jobs, causes clients to lose their employment and become unable to find new jobs. However, outpatient setting provides less medical support for detoxification, less intensive treatment, while patients have easier access to substances. As a result, inpatient care or intensive detox treatment is likely to be more effective than ambulatory care in terms of reducing frequency of substance usage. 

Regarding housing status, a higher proportion of clients under rehab/residential treatment become both better and worse in terms of their living arrangements compared to those admitted to ambulatory or detox treatment. While the critical nature of rehab may signify more severe substance abuse problems in clients, which may lead to difficulties in retaining and applying for housing, there are also recovery housing programs that can assist those completing rehab/residential treatment with accommodations e.g. the U.S. Department of Housing’s Recovery Housing Program provides eligible individuals in recovery from substance use disorder with transitional housing for up to 2 years. Such programs are likely to vary by the clients' state regulations as well as the specificities of their diagnoses, which can potentially account for the varying impact of treatment setting on housing.


## Limitations

Due to differences in state policies, with some states regulating private agencies or correctional facilities while others don’t, the demographic and treatment-related factors might differ across states, which has the potential to impact our research result. Second, our quality of life indicators are limited to the time periods near clients' admission or discharge point, so our analysis cannot take into account changes in quality of life after treatment in longer terms. In addition, since there are no data on the specific treatment each individual receives, our research are limited regarding which specific treatment conditions will have a significant impact on quality of life outcome post-discharge. 

## Future Directions

This project can be taken in many different directions. While working on this, our experts recommended to us to examine state policy to see how it impacts outcomes. There are significant discrepancies in state policies and the facilities / treatment services they can provide. For example, running out of beds or being unable to provide outpatient treatment is very common in Minnesota. If a team could access that data, it could be a rich domain to explore, especially when connecting it to Length of Stay and Treatment Service Type (SERVICES).

Additionally obviously this is only the 2021 TEDS_D dataset. There is always the opportunity to go back in time and compare rates to our findings to see how they size up. This could even be done in conjunction with the state policy and funding route in order to gain a very comprehensive view of the evolution of the quality of life indicators and their relationships to the state.

Finally, our analysis covered only one period: from admission to 30 days prior to discharge. This is a very narrow scope, therefore collecting more data through a new dataset or finding willing participants to share their housing, employment, and frequency of use statuses prior to and post treatment would greatly expand our understanding of these issues and help make our findings more accurate.
